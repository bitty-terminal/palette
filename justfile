# Quality gates for Bitty Palette (bitty-terminal.palette).
#
# Dependencies live in package.json and are locked in bun.lock; `just install`
# materializes them. Installed tools are invoked with `bun run <bin>` so every
# gate resolves from node_modules and runs offline once install has completed.
# The manifest gate runs the authoritative SDK linter (bitty-plugin-lint,
# commit-pinned in package.json + bun.lock), not a vendored re-implementation.
# A gate with missing dependencies fails closed (`just deps`) instead of
# fetching. Never use npm, npx, or yarn in this repository.

# List available recipes.
default:
    @just --list

# Install pinned dev dependencies from bun.lock. This is the only gate step
# that may use the network; install once, then `just check` is offline.
install:
    bun install --frozen-lockfile

# Fail closed when dependencies are absent, so a gate never silently fetches
# from the network. Run `just install` first.
deps:
    @test -d node_modules || { echo "dependencies are not installed; run 'just install'" >&2; exit 1; }

# Publish a redacted CarryCtx snapshot inside this repo (commander merge
# closeout only; never a git hook). `carryctx export --publication` redacts the
# bundle, stamps manifest.redacted, and commits one snapshot to the fixed ref
# `refs/heads/carryctx-snapshots`; the target pushes that branch only when the
# local ref advanced (native carryctx commits one snapshot per export, so a
# re-run publishes again rather than no-opping). Canonical closeout runs from
# the primary checkout on branch main
# (`cd "$BITTY_WORKSPACE/palette" && just workflow-publish`).
